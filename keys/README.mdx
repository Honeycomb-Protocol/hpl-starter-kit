# Generating keys

Make sure to [install Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) (needed for generating keys). Then run the following commands from the root of the project:

```bash

solana-keygen new --outfile keys/admin.json

```

This will generate a new keypair and save it to `keys/admin.json`. Please generate another file for the `user` keypair.

```bash

solana-keygen new --outfile keys/user.json

```

Fund these accounts with some SOL to run the demos.

```bash

solana airdrop 100 --url OUR_RPC_URL -k ./keys/admin.json

```

```bash

solana airdrop 100 --url OUR_RPC_URL -k ./keys/user.json

```

This will fund each wallet with 100 SOL each on our RPC. Please note that you'll need to [contact us](mailto:hello@honeycombprotocol.com) to acquire our RPC and API URLs.
