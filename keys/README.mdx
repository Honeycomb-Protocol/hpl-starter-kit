# Generating keys

Generally, you can run the setup.sh located at the root of this repo to generate everything, including the keys, for you.

However, if you want to generate the keys manually, you can follow the instructions below.

Make sure to [install Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) (needed for generating keys). Then run the following commands from the root of the project:

```bash

solana-keygen new --outfile keys/admin.json

```

This will generate a new keypair and save it to `keys/admin.json`. Please generate another file for the `user` keypair.

```bash

solana-keygen new --outfile keys/user.json

```

Fund these accounts with some SOL to run the demos.

```bash

solana airdrop 100 --url https://rpc.test.honeycombprotocol.com/ -k ./keys/admin.json

```

```bash

solana airdrop 100 --url https://rpc.test.honeycombprotocol.com/ -k ./keys/user.json

```

This will fund each wallet with 100 SOL each on our RPC. Happy testing!
