# Honeycomb Protocol Usage Demos

This repository contains a collection of demos that showcase how to use the Honeycomb Protocol. 

## Steps

There are two ways to setup the demos:

### 1. Use the setup script

1. Run the setup script located at the root of this repo. The script will install all dependencies and generate everything for you. If you're on Windows, you'll need to run the .sh file in Bash since it's a Unix shell script.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Manual setup

1. Make sure to [install Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) (needed for generating keys).

2. Run `yarn` or `npm` to install all dependencies.

3. Generate the keys needed for the demos. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile ./keys/admin.json
```

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile ./keys/user.json
```

4. Airdrop some SOL to the admin and user accounts. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
solana airdrop 10 --url https://rpc.test.honeycombprotocol.com/ --keypair ./keys/admin.json
```

```bash
solana airdrop 10 --url https://rpc.test.honeycombprotocol.com/ --keypair ./keys/user.json
```

5. Create a `.env` file at the root of this repo and add the following:

```env
API_URL="https://edge.test.honeycombprotocol.com/"
RPC_URL="https://rpc.test.honeycombprotocol.com/"
DAS_API_URL="https://rpc.test.honeycombprotocol.com/"
```

You're all set, you can now run the demos.

## Running the demos

Each demo covers a different use-case of Honeycomb. The demos are written as tests that can be run either individually or all at once.

To run all the demos, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

To run a specific demo, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test <filename without .test.ts>
```

For example:

```bash
yarn test hiveControl
```
