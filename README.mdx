# Honeycomb Protocol Usage Demos

This repository contains a collection of demos that showcase how to use the Honeycomb Protocol. 

## Steps

1. Make sure to [install Solana CLI](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) (needed for generating keys).

2. Run `yarn` or `npm` to install all dependencies.

3. Run the setup script located at the root of this repo. The script will generate everything, including the keys, for you. You'll need to run it in either Bash or WSL.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

## Running the demos

Each demo covers a different use-case of Honeycomb. The demos are written as tests that can be run either individually or all at once.

To run all the demos, use the following command:

```bash

yarn test

```

To run a specific demo, use the following command:

```bash

yarn test <filename without .test.ts>

```

For example:

```bash

yarn test hiveControl

```
